Microphone Wind noise Analysis for input file test/iphone1.wav

Wind Noise Statistics, % number of frames with wind noise detected at the following Signal to noise Ratios (high values = good quality low values = bad quality). also presented is the range in Quality Degradation that each SNR range represents.

SNR range;	>20dB,	20 to 10dB,	10 to 0dB,	0 to -10dB,	-10 to -20dB,	<-20dB
Qual. Degradation;	<24%,	24 to 40%,	40 to 54%,	54 to 69%,	69 to 95%,	>95%
% of time in each SNR range;	45.5,	0.0,	9.1,	27.3,	9.1,	9.1
